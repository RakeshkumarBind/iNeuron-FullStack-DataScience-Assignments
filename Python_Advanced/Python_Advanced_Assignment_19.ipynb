    "<b>Answer:</b><br>A class stores several types of knowledge, including:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1.`Attributes`: Classes define attributes (also known as data members) that describe the properties or characteristics of objects that belong to the class. Attributes represent the state of an object and are used to store information about the object. For example, a Car class might have attributes like color, make, model, and year.<br>\n",
    "2.`Methods`: Classes define methods (also known as functions) that describe the behavior of objects that belong to the class. Methods represent actions or operations that can be performed on an object. For example, a Car class might have methods like start_engine(), accelerate(), and brake().<br>\n",
    "3.`Properties`: Classes can also define properties, which are read-only attributes that provide additional information about an object. Properties are typically used to provide a concise way to access and manipulate attribute values. For example, a Car class might have a property called speed that returns the current speed of the car.<br>\n",
    "4.`Events`: Classes can define events, which are notifications that occur when something significant happens to an object. Events allow objects to communicate with each other and respond to changes in the environment. For example, a Car class might have an event called horn_honked that is triggered when the horn is honked.<br>\n",
    "5.`Static variables and methods`: Classes can also define static variables and methods, which are shared among all instances of the class. Static variables and methods are useful when you need to store or manipulate data that is common to all instances of a class. For example, a Math class might have a static method called sqrt() that calculates the square root of a number.<br>\n",
    "6.`Inner classes and interfaces`: Classes can contain inner classes and interfaces, which are nested classes that provide additional functionality. Inner classes and interfaces are useful when you need to group related classes together or define a contract for a class to implement.<br>\n",
    "7.`Enums`: Classes can also define enums, which are special classes that represent a set of named constants. Enums are useful when you need to define a set of named values that can be used in different parts of your program."

    "<b>Answer:</b><br>A method is a block of code that is associated with a class or object. It is similar to a regular function in that it performs a specific task, but there are some key differences. Here are the main differences between a method and a regular function:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1.`Association with a class or object`: A method is associated with a class or object, whereas a regular function is not. This means that a method has access to the data and properties of the class or object it belongs to, and can modify them if necessary.<br>\n",
    "2.`Access to private data`: Because a method is associated with a class or object, it has access to the private data and properties of that class or object. Regular functions do not have access to private data unless they are passed as arguments.<br>\n",
    "3.`Ability to modify the class or object`: Since a method has access to the private data and properties of the class or object it belongs to, it can modify them if necessary. Regular functions cannot modify the data they are given as input.<br>\n",
    "4.`Scope`: The scope of a method is limited to the class or object it belongs to, whereas the scope of a regular function is global. This means that a method can only be accessed within the context of the class or object it belongs to, while a regular function can be accessed from anywhere in the program.<br>\n",
    "5.`Calling conventions`: Methods are typically called using the dot notation (e.g., obj.method()), while regular functions are called using the function name (e.g., func()).<br>\n",
    "6.`Return value`: Methods can return a value to the caller, just like regular functions. However, methods can also return a value to the class or object they belong to, which can be used to update the state of the class or object.<br>\n",
    "7.`Parameters`: Both methods and regular functions can take parameters, but methods can also take \"self\" as a parameter, which refers to the class or object the method belongs to.<br>\n",
    "8.`Overloading`: Methods can be overloaded, meaning that multiple methods with the same name can be defined for different purposes. Regular functions cannot be overloaded in this way.<br>\n",
    "9.`Polymorphism`: Methods can exhibit polymorphism, meaning that they can behave differently depending on the type of object they are called on. Regular functions do not support polymorphism.<br>"

   "source": [
    "<b>Answer:</b><br>In Python, class variables and instance variables are distinguished based on their scope and usage. Here are some ways to differentiate between the two:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1.`Scope`: Class variables are defined inside a class definition and have a wider scope, meaning they can be accessed from within any part of the class, including within methods and nested classes. Instance variables, on the other hand, are defined inside an instance of a class and have a narrower scope, meaning they can only be accessed from within the instance itself.<br>\n",
    "2.`Lifespan`: Class variables exist as long as the class exists, whereas instance variables are created when an instance of the class is created and destroyed when the instance is garbage collected.<br>\n",
    "3.`Access modifiers`: Class variables are typically defined without any access modifiers, which means they can be accessed from anywhere within the class. Instance variables, on the other hand, may have access modifiers such as public, private, or protected to control their visibility and accessibility.<br>\n",
    "4.`Purpose`: Class variables are often used to store static data or constants that are shared among all instances of a class, while instance variables are used to store dynamic data that varies across different instances of a class.<br>\n",
    "5.`Syntax`: When defining a class variable, you don't need to specify a reference to the class explicitly. However, when accessing a class variable from within an instance method, you need to qualify it with the class name, e.g., MyClass.variable. On the other hand, instance variables are defined within an instance method using the self parameter, e.g., self.variable.<br>\n",
    "6.`Usage`: Class variables are useful when you want to share data or functionality among multiple instances of a class. Instance variables, on the other hand, are useful when you want to store unique data or behavior specific to each individual instance of a class."

For example, if we write type(obj) then Python will return an object which represents the type of obj. Using reflection, we can write one recursive reverse function that will work for strings, lists, and any other sequence that supports slicing and concatenation. If an obj is a reference to a string, then Python will return the str type object. Further, if we write str() we get a string which is the empty string. In other words, writing str() is the same thing as writing “”. Likewise, writing list() is the same thing as writing []."
