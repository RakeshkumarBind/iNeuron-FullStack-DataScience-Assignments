    " Inheritence is nothing but reusing the code of Parent class by the child class. Similary when a child class inherits its properties from multiple Parent classes this scenario is called Multiple Inheritence. Multiple inheritance is a feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an object or class can inherit features from more than one parent object or parent class. It is distinct from single inheritance, where an object or class may only inherit from one particular object or class."

    "In Python, there is no strict concept of \"private\" attributes or methods in the same way that some other programming languages have. However, Python provides a convention for making attributes or methods less accessible from outside the class by prefixing their names with a double underscore __ (underscore underscore).
