    "1.`Assignment Expressions (The Walrus Operator)`:The assignment expression operator := allows you to assign a value to a variable as part of an expression. This is useful for assignments within conditional statements and comprehensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.`Positional-Only Parameters`:Python 3.8 introduced the ability to define positional-only parameters in function signatures using the / syntax. These parameters can only be passed by position, not by keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.`f-strings Improvements`:f-strings (formatted string literals) gained new capabilities, such as support for the = operator to display both the expression and its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.`Syntax Warnings`:Python 3.8 introduced new syntax warnings for cases where the code might be misleading, such as using == to compare singletons like None.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.`Math Functions Enhancements`:The math.prod() function was introduced to compute the product of iterable elements.\n",
    "New mathematical functions like math.dist() and math.isqrt() were added.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.`New Modules`:The zoneinfo module was introduced for working with time zones.\n",
    "The typing module improvements included support for Protocol and Literal types.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.`Performance Improvements`:Python 3.8 included various performance optimizations, making certain operations faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.`New Syntax Features`:Python 3.8 introduced the __future__ annotations for forward compatibility, enabling features from future Python versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.`Other Enhancements`:Various standard library enhancements and bug fixes.\n",
    "Security improvements and updated libraries."
